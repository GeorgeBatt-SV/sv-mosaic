# i18n

Mosaic comes with i18n capability built in by wrapping the capabilities provided by `react-i18next` and `i18next`. This system is primarly used for translating the user interface itself, it is not intended to translate the data of your application, generally you'll want to do that in a different way.

In order to use the system there are really two primary ways to utilize it. You can utilize the default i18n instance and add your bundles to it, or you can utilize the context API to pass a mosaic settings context. Which you will use depends on the needs of your application.

* If you can, utilize the context API variant, it will provide the best long-term pattern for access.
* If you are porting a legacy application without a global root you can wrap in a react context, then you may want to add your bundles to the default instance.

In general to use i18n, there are 2 primary things you need to do.

1. `i18n.addResourceBundle` to register your bundles.
1. `const { t } = useMosaicTranslation()` to translate within your components.

## Best Practices

The recommended best practice is to do the the following:

1. `mosaic` itself uses the namespace `mosaic`, so your application should never register nor alter any data on the mosaic namespace or you risk breaking the core system.
1. You are free to register multiple namespaces, or just use one namespace for your application. The recommended namespace for you application is just `app`.
1. i18n references translation keys by `t("namespace:key.key.key")`. When feasible, split your data bundles up by component/system so that you would access a key by `app:ComponentName.key`. In example, `app:Users.users` and `app:Accounts.company`.
1. If you are sharing references between many components feel free to create a `app:shared` or `app:common` which contains shared linguistic references. Don't put everything here, or else it will be a merge conflict nightmare because every new pull will modify this.
1. In `mosaic` core each component has a single file which contains all languages for that component, rather than splitting it up per language. We recommend doing the same if you are splitting your files by system/component.
1. Use the `cimode` language to output the full key name in the UI, this can be used as a tool for ensuring that all elements have been localized.
1. Mosaic exposes a `mosaic:common` area of commonly used keys that are likely used in almost all user interfaces e.g. "save", "cancel", "label". It is safe to utilize any key in there. If you believe a key should be added, please submit a ticket to the MOS project.
	* All keys available at https://github.com/simpleviewinc/sv-mosaic/blob/develop/src/i18n/common.json .
1. Keys cannot contain "." so if you need to represent something like "Read more..." a way of naming the key is "read_more___" using "_" to replace the ".".

## Usage

From your outer-most component, register your mosaic settings via the react context API. When registered all components inside of that context have access to the bundles declared.

```js
import {
	useMosaicSettings,
	MosaicContext,
} from "@simpleviewinc/sv-mosaic";

function MyComponent() {
	...
	const mosaicSettings = useMosaicSettings();
	// load bundles, however you do that
	mosaicSettings.i18n.addResourceBundle();
	...

	return (
		<MosaicContext.Provider value={mosaicSettings}>
			<App/>
		</MosaicContext>
	)
}
```

If there is a reason you can't utilize an outer context wrapper, you can utilize the `defaulti18n` object which is what mosaic defaults to use internally. The downside is that you are effectively using a global variable, so you can only ever have 1 language bundle system or instance. In practice, this may be fine for your app.

```js
import {
	defaulti18n
} from "@simpleview/sv-mosaic";

// load your bundles
defaulti18n.addResourceBundle();
```

Within a component utilize the `useMosaicTranslation()` hook to translate content.

```js
import {
	useMosaicTranslation
} from "@simpleview/sv-mosaic";

function MyComponent() {
	const { t } = useMosaicTranslation();

	return (
		<p>{t("app:MyComponent.mykey")}</p>
	)
}
```

## Loading Bundles

You should pick a philosophy for how you will load your bundles. Our recommendation is that you either load per-language or per-component. Per-language is better if you want to keep the translation for your app in one language in one place, but it may be more prone to merge conflicts. Per-component is better when you are ok bundling the localization with the component itself, this spreads your localization throughout your repo but makes your components more self-contained. It is similar to the single global CSS file vs modular CSS files debate.

### Per-language

If using a per-language strategy, then you will load a single bundle for a whole language.

https://www.i18next.com/overview/api#addresourcebundle

```js
const mosaicSettings = useMosaicSettings();
mosaicSettings.i18n.addResourceBundle("en", "app", {
	MyComponent : {
		// data
	}
});
mosaicSettings.i18n.addResourceBundle("es", "app", {
	MyComponent : {
		// data
	}
});
```

### Per-component

If using a per-component strategy, then you can use the `mosaic.addResourceBundle` helper. You can add the following code to the main component file or it's index barrel, if using barrelling.

```js
import * as localeData from "./DataViewLocales.json";
import { addResourceBundle } from "@simpleview/sv-mosaic";

addResouceBundle({
	prefix : "MyComponent",
	namespace : "app",
	bundle : {
		en : {
			// data
		},
		es : {
			// data
		}
	}
});

// this will register data accessible at t("app:MyComponent.key")
```
