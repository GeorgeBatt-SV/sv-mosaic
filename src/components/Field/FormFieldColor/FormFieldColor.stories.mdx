This field implements the [**FieldDef**](#generic-field-props-fielddef) interface.

- The color picker component allows users to select from pre-defined colors (swatches) or custom colors using a HSB selection interface.
- The implementation of this component is based on the following package: [React Color](https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/)
- [**Playground**](/?path=/story/formfields-formfieldcolor--playground)
- Data: `string` - Text that represents the hex value of the color picker.
- inputSettings: This component doesn't require any additional props.
