# Spinner

The `Sp√≠nner` component is built over a wrapper for [MUI Circular Progress](https://mui.com/joy-ui/react-circular-progress/) but with SimpleView brand colors.

Used when wanting to show the user that something is loading, for example when fetching data from a Data Base. The component can be set to spin indifinitely or to show a specific progress value (from 0 to 100).
