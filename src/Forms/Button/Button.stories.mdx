# Button

The buttons designed for the forms are the following:

- Primary. Used for the most important action on a page or in a view
- Secondary. Used for the subordinate, cancel and display actions
- Text Buttons. Are applied as a subtle call to action, but this style also includes danger or cancel interactions.
